Welcome to my Text Faces Bot!\
\
With this bot you can get your favorite text faces such as the classic (
͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  right from your favorite chatting app.\
You can type in !faces (or !faces-dm for a private DM) for a list of
faces and their commands at any time.\

This bot was written in discord.js\

If you would like to use this bot for yourself make sure you have
[Node.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nodejs.org&sa=D&ust=1597155937935000&usg=AOvVaw0gfG7X_QuhTINPdWa4lfxu) and
[discord.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://discord.js.org&sa=D&ust=1597155937936000&usg=AOvVaw1HIe-WaOeAi_WrZLD5-L_-) installed.
Also make sure you have a code editor just in case. I would recommend
[Microsoft Visual Studio
Code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/&sa=D&ust=1597155937936000&usg=AOvVaw188nKiBIOMV98TA86ykIk5).\
\
If you are going to use this, make sure to replace
“client.login(process.env.BOT\_TOKEN);//BOT\_TOKEN is the Client
Secret” with “client.login('your-token-goes-here');“ at the bottom of
bot.js (replace “your-token-goes-here” with your bot token but don’t get
rid of the two ' symbols at the beginning and end of the text.\
