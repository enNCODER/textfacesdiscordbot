Welcome to my Text Faces Bot!\
\
With this bot you can get your favorite text faces such as the classic (
͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  right from your favorite chatting app.\
You can type in !faces (or !faces-dm for a private DM) for a list of
faces and their commands at any time. Or you can just DM the bot and
type in !faces or any other command and it will work too.\

If you would like to use this bot for yourself make sure you have
[Node.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nodejs.org&sa=D&ust=1597188457261000&usg=AOvVaw2s-GAnu5-4OJfS_wvS_6MY) and

Also make sure you have a code editor just in case. I would recommend
[Microsoft Visual Studio
Code](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://code.visualstudio.com/&sa=D&ust=1597188457261000&usg=AOvVaw0fo1hV3tmvRDQyFYiINw5R).\
\
If you are going to use this, make sure to replace
“client.login(process.env.BOT\_TOKEN);//BOT\_TOKEN is the Client
Secret” with “client.login('your-token-goes-here');“ at the bottom of
bot.js (replace “your-token-goes-here” with your bot token but don’t get
rid of the two ' at the beginning and end of the text.\
